- ðŸ‘‹<h> Hi, I'm Sebastian, </h>
<p>I've recently decided to do web developemtn outside of my job and help small business and people who need coaching</p>
<p> I've been a front-end web developer for quite sometime now with full skills and expertise in javaScript(see what i did there :-D ) </p>

<h2> What are my passions </h2>
<p> I love creating things digitally, not just websites and code but art illustrations in Adobe platforms as well, art, video editing, photo manipulation and so on </p>

<h2> What Makes Me unique as a web developer? </h2>
<p> While most <b>developers<b> boast about their experience and their skills, which is important, I'm more focused on precision and consistency. </p>
<p> What does that mean? When I'm doing a project for a business, I focus on getting the maximum conversion for everybody using the website instead of just designing appeal </p>

<h2> How Do I Create High Conversion Websites? <h2>
<p> It's simple really, I create websites in a way that leads clients eyes straight to your call to action through sleek headings, colors and styled words</p>
