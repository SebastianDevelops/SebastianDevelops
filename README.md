- ðŸ‘‹<h> Hi, I'm Sebastian, </h>
<p> I've been writing code before i knew how to spell my first name, the coding I used to do was not anything difficult or top class but I was able to code my first website at the age of 10. Nothing out of this world, just simple HTML. </p>
  <p> There is one huge problem tho. Throughout my life I always took programming as a "On and Off" thing... Until recently, Until I finished school and had the time to really focus on learning code. Honestly it feels like i was a programmer in my past life because learning is just so easy, to a point where i pefer being self--taught instead of attending a school. </p>
  <p> Yes, I do struggle in multiple places, especially in Javascript but I will never move past something without understanding it fully. Being a programmer is what I feel I was born for bewcause it was the first skill I learned in my life, although I left it just to come back. I feel now that I will do it for the rest of my life </p>
  <h3>Why would I be a programmer for the rest of my life?</h3>
  <p> This industry is never stagnant.</p>
  <p>I'm a person who always self-improves and being in an industry like this, my mind would never stand at one place. I'd aleways be improving myself and my skill</p>
  <p> I've perfected web development on the front end side of things and I'm going inot back-end now.</p>
  <p>I've been researching the first language that I hould learn when it comes to back-end development and lots of people said that I should learn Phython Code.</p>
  <p>I considered learning this until I came across the future of all dev, web 3.0</p>
  <p>I further did my research on web 3 and came across blockchain development on the Binance Smart Chain. The back-end code used here on this blockchain is called Solidity. This is what im currently perfecting my skill on for the back-end as I feel that Web 3 is the future and there are so few people who know how to develop on it.</p>
